Part 2:

Something I learned in the second half of the quarter that I did not know before was how useful Vim was. Despite being rather inconveient to learn, it is a very helpful tool in order to make changes without the use of an interface such as VSCode, and enables quick traversal of files without having to open any external programs. While I initially (and in a way, still do) saw it as a glorified notepad app, I understand how Vim can be valuable in the workplace, especially in scenarios where you can't normally access a dedicated app in order to fix errors. What I still don't understand, however, is how one would use this without a guide, as there are a lot of unintuitive parts to Vim that would not be something one would think of upon first using Vim.
