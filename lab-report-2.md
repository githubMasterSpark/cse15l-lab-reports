Something from Labs 2 and 3 that I did not know before was how the terminal could connect to the internet. While I initially regarded the terminal as a small opening where you can view a computer's programs directly, I did not know you could connect to the internet, and by extension, work on remote desktops and interfaces. This enables remote installation and manipulation of programs located on other devices, which can be used for troubleshooting.
