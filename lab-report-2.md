1. The method in the code that is called is ```handleRequest```. This method takes an ```URI``` and depending on the input, displays or concatenates other ```strings``` into a signular ```string``` in a pseudo-list format using and incrementing the ```size``` parameter. Through this specific request, the empty ```string``` was concatenated with a ```string``` containing with "1. Hello" before generating a new line for use with the next concatenation.

The path that the private key is located in is ```/c/Users/benja/.ssh/id_rsa.pub```, I cannot use ```ls``` to explicitly point to the file as it only prints out ```id_rsa.pub``` instead of the private key itself, nor can I use ```cd``` as it is not a directory.

The path that the public key is located in is ```/home/linux/ieng6/cs15lfa23/cs15lfa23qc/.ssh/authroized_keys```, I cannot use ```ls``` to explicitly point to the file as it only prints out ```authroized_keys``` instead of the public key itself, nor can I use ```cd``` as it is not a directory.

Part 3:
Something from Labs 2 and 3 that I did not know before was how the terminal could connect to the internet. While I initially regarded the terminal as a small opening where you can view a computer's programs directly, I did not know you could connect to the internet, and by extension, work on remote desktops and interfaces. This enables remote installation and manipulation of programs located on other devices, which can be used for troubleshooting.
