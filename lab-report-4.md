I logged into ieng6, using keys in order to automatically log in without having to type in my password.

Using the ```SSH``` URL, I cloned a fork of the repository from my Github account.

I ran the code using ```bash test.sh``` to verify that a test is currently failing.

I typed ```vim ListExamples.java``` in order to access the Vim text editor. 
Then, I typed ```? index1``` in order to perform a reverse search (as I already know where the error is) in order to find the erronous line of code.
Once I had found the code to search by pressing ```<enter>```, I typed ```<l><l><l><l><l><r><2>``` in order to traverse to the right and replace the '1' with a '2'.
Finally, I typed ```:wq!``` to save the changes made and exit Vim.

I ran the code using ```bash test.sh``` to verify that the changes I have made now pass the tests.

I typed ```git commit -a``` in order to stage the changes for committing. After typing my comment, I typed ```:wq!``` to save my committing message. Then I typed ```git push``` to push my commits.
